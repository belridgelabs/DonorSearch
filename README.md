# DonorSearch
For political candidates to source potential campaign donors based on their personal keywords (Ex. Sikh, First Generation American, School Teacher, Veteran).

This tool takes your keywords, identifies potential donors, qualifies and ranks them by analyzing their previous donation history, and then sources their contact information for you.

Essentially a free campaign finance manager.
